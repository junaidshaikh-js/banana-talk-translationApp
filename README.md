### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension language
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

1. Working with API - In this project I used the [funtranslations.com](https://funtranslations.com/) to convert English into Banana language

2. How to make request using `fetch()` API and then manipulate the received data.

A general syntax of `fetch()` method is

```js
fetch("http://example.com/movies.json")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```
